REMARK:
    *controller is unstructured due to not applied proper 
    i) attribute routing, 
    ii) rout prefix,
    iii) rout constraint and 
    iv) rout parameter.  (DONE)
    *there is no model validation(Data annotation or fluent model valaidation).
    dotnet add pckage
    *there is a lack of joining because atleast you need to have two tables for relationship. Give proper demostration (One To One) or (One To Many).
    **do write Asyncronous programming by implementing class (Async ans Await).
    Security:
    ***controller is insecure means their is no authentication so, we need to write logic for securing the controller using custom Middelware.
    *need to handle runtime exceptions using try, throw, catch.
